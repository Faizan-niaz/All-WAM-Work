        <strong>Paragraph 1</strong><br>
        <b>Imran Khan is a Pakistani politician,</b> former cricketer, and the current Prime Minister of Pakistan. He
        was born on October 5, 1952, in Lahore, Pakistan. Khan is the founder and leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf
        (PTI) party, which is one of the major political parties in Pakistan.

        Before entering politics, Imran Khan had a successful career in cricket. He captained the Pakistan national
        cricket team and led them to their first-ever Cricket World Cup victory in 1992. He is considered one of the
        greatest cricketers in Pakistan's history.
    </p> <br><br>
    <p>
        <strong>Paragraph 1</strong><br>
        <i>In the political realm,</i> Khan emerged as a prominent figure advocating for social justice and
        anti-corruption. He founded PTI in 1996 and gradually gained popularity for his strong stance against corruption
        and his promises to reform the country's governance.

        After several unsuccessful attempts, Imran Khan's party achieved a significant breakthrough in the 2018 general
        elections, securing the most seats in the National Assembly. Consequently, he became the 22nd Prime Minister of
        Pakistan on August 18, 2018.
